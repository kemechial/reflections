What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git adds a .git directory into the folder. By creating a repository, I will be able to track the changes on my project and undo them when needed or add a new version with test features easily.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers us the option to save the changes in different commits, because changes in different files can refer to different logical steps.
