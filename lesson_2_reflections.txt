What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git adds a .git directory into the folder. By creating a repository, I will be able to track the changes on my project and undo them when needed or add a new version with test features easily.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers us the option to save the changes in different commits, because changes in different files can refer to different logical steps.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add one logical change to the staging area, commit it then repeat for the second logial change, so they are committed separately.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
It would be helpful when you want to create different versions of the app.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams are really beneficial, when you want to clearly understand the version history of the Repository.
I will try merging.
